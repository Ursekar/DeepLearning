# AI Programming with Python Project

Develop code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
You can open the Jupyter notebook to view code and its detailed implementation line by line.

train.py, predict.py, checkpoint.py are files for its implementation as command line application with use of parser allowing you to specify;

1.) hidden layers,

2.) input image, 

3.) the json labels file and its path, 

4.) number of epochs, 

5.) the display of validation and training loss and accuracy after number of batches in each epoch,

6.) choosing model as either densenet121 or vgg13.
