# AI Programming with Python Project

**Goal**:  
Build an image classifier that classifies more than 100 breeds of flowers.

**Why?**:  
Industry requires such image classifiers to classify several different products of a company on conveyor belt. Image classifiers are used for varied range of industry processes. Hence, developing such application or working in this area can help me depict recruiters my detailed knowledge of building image classifiers which classifies more than 100 categories which an industry requires. This is a work of real-life data scientist.

**How?**:  
Developed a code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then convert it into a command line application.
You can open the Jupyter notebook to view code and its detailed implementation line by line.

**Application & User Customization options**:  
train.py, predict.py, checkpoint.py are files for its implementation as command line application with use of parser allowing you to specify;  
1.) hidden layers,  
2.) input image,  
3.) the json labels file and its path,  
4.) number of epochs,  
5.) the display of validation and training loss and accuracy after number of batches in each epoch,  
6.) choosing model as either densenet121 or vgg13.
